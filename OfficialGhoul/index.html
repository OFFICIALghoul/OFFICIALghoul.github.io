            <h2>What is Ghoul?</h2>
            <p>Ghoul is a simple encryption/decryption tool that uses the Caesar Cipher method. It is a simple
                substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter a certain number of positions down the
                alphabet.</p>
            <p>For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.</p>
            <p>It is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.</p>
            <p>It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some
                fixed number of positions down the alphabet.</p>
            <p>For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.</p>
            <p>The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.</p>
            <p>Encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties
                can access it and those who are not authorized cannot.</p>
            <p>Decryption is the process of taking encoded or encrypted text or other data and converting it back into
                text that you or the computer can read and understand.</p>

            <h2>How to use Ghoul?</h2>
            <p>First, you need to choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message.</p>
            <p>Then, you need to insert the message you want to encrypt/decrypt.</p>
            <p>After that, you need to insert a number between 1-20, which will be used to encrypt/decrypt the message.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, you need to click the button and the result will be displayed.</p>
            <p>For example, if you want to encrypt the message "Hello" with a shift of 3, the result will be "Khoor".
            </p>
            <p>And if you want to decrypt the message "Khoor" with a shift of 3, the result will be "Hello".</p>
